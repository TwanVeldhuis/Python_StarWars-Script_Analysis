# Star Wars Trilogy Text Mining and NLP Project

This project focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining techniques to analyze the dialogues in the Star Wars Original Trilogy scripts. The goal is to extract insights and gain a deeper understanding of the iconic movie series through linguistic analysis.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2. Analyze the frequency distribution of words in The Original Trilogy.
3. Create a frequency distribution plot of the most used words in The Original Trilogy.
4. Perform text-mining operations to preprocess the dataset for further analysis using NLTK.
5. Reanalyze the frequency distribution of words after preprocessing.
6. Create Word Clouds to represent the most used words for Darth Vader and Yoda.
7. Identify the most relevant words in The Original Trilogy script using the TF-IDF model.
8. Perform sentiment analysis on the movie scripts to determine the overall sentiment of the trilogy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of the script dialogues between characters from the first three Star Wars movies (episodes 4-6), known as The Original Trilogy. The scripts provide the textual data necessary for analysis and exploration.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Python scripts in the provided Jupyter notebooks in sequential order.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to perform various text mining and NLP analyses.
5. Generate visualizations, frequency distribution plots, and word clouds to gain insights.
6. Analyze sentiment using appropriate techniques and models.
7. Modify the code as needed and explore additional analyses to enhance the project.

## Resources

The project utilizes the following libraries:

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text mining and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and plotting.
- Wordcloud for generating word clouds.
- Scikit-learn for TF-IDF analysis and sentiment analysis.

Tutorials and articles that may be helpful for understanding the concepts and techniques employed in this project are provided in the resources section.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you have any ideas for improvements, additional analyses, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Credits

This project was inspired by a Kaggle competition dedicated to Star Wars Day. The dataset used in this project is sourced from that competition.

May the Force be with you!
